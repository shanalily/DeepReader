# DeepReader


## **What is DeepReader?**

DeepReader, initially created as a CSCI2963 project, is an application that increases comprehension of textbooks by requiring the user to take notes as they read, and then checking the quality of the notes. DeepReader is implemented mainly in C++, using QtWidgets and Poppler.


## **How do I run DeepReader?**

Download [Qt Creator version 4.5](https://www.qt.io/download/) and [Poppler Qt5](https://people.freedesktop.org/~aacid/docs/qt5/). Intsructions on installing both can be found in the DeepReader Wiki. From there open all files in the DeepReader folder in Qt Creator (Open Qt Creator -> File -> Open Project -> Select all files in DeepReader folder -> Open) and hit the run button. This will execute the application.
